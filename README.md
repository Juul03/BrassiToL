# Brassitol

Welcome to our repository of BrassiToL. This is a project for projectleader Kasper Hendriks from Naturalis, build in a 6 week study program in the third year of the bachelor Communication and Multimedia Design (CMD) at HvA.

## What is the BrassiToL?
The BrassiToL is a tree of life, made by Kasper Hendriks, for the family from the Brassicaceae. We were asked to develop a website where this tree will become interactive and where you can filter between different Taxonomy, Geographical and Miscellaneous categories.

BrassiToL contains a dropdown menu, a search bar, filters, d3 visualization (phylogenetic tree and geographical map). 

In the Taxonomy category you can select a sample, genus, tribe, supertribe and subfamily. When users do this, what you select lights up in the tree with bold and color. 

The application is build for desktop screens.
